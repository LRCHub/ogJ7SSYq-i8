[00:00.47] My feet are aching
[00:03.53] And your back is pretty tired
[00:06.97] And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
[00:11.21] And set our grief aside
[00:22.71] 
[00:14.28] The papers say it's doomsday
[00:18.93] The button has been pressed
[00:22.97] We're gonna nuke each other up, boys
[00:26.26] 'Til old Satan stands impressed
[00:41.76] 
[00:31.61] And here it is, our final night alive
[00:38.39] And as the Earth burns to the ground
[00:43.63] Oh girl, it's you that I lie with
[00:53.62] As the atom bomb locks in
[01:01.27] Oh, it's you I watch TV with
[01:09.32] As the world, as the world caves in
[01:26.82] 
[01:23.64] You put your finest suit on
[01:29.64] I paint my fingernails
[01:33.33] Oh, we're going out in style, babe
[01:36.99] And everything's on sale
[01:48.99] 
[01:40.70] We creep up on extinction
[01:44.39] I pull your arms right in
[01:48.26] I weep and say goodnight love
[01:51.97] While my organs pack it in
[02:04.97] 
[01:57.94] And here it is, our final night alive
[02:03.65] And as the Earth burns to the ground
[02:09.04] Oh girl, it's you that I lie with
[02:18.33] As the atom bomb locks in
[02:26.37] Oh, it's you I watch TV with
[02:33.78] As the world, as the world caves
[02:49.78] 
[02:41.40] Oh, it's you that I lie with
[02:48.45] As the atom bomb locks in
[02:56.20] Yes, it's you I welcome death with
[03:03.17] As the world, as the world caves in
[03:20.67] 
[03:26.86] As the world caves in
